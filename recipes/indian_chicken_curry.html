        <li>8 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

        <li>4 teaspoons ground cumin</li>        
        <li>4 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>        
        <li>4 teaspoons ground coriander</li>        
        <li>4 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>       
        <li>4 tablespoons water</li>        
        <li>4 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>        
        <li>4 cups plain yogurt</li>        
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>        
        <li>4 teaspoons salt</li>        
        <li>2 cups water</li>        
        <li>4 teaspoons garam masala</li>        
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>        
        <li>4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>

        
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in 
            batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
            
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent,
             5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; 
             allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.</li>
            
            
        <li>Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.</li>
            
        <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, 
            turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
            
            
        <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
    </ol>
